# liri-node-app

This node.js-based application takes user input, and responds by providing data from several sources.
These include Twitter, the Spotify music service, and the OMDB movie data service.

It also features functionality to essentially take a command directive from a particular in-directory text file.

Valid input statements include the following.

node liri.js movie-this Star Wars

node liri.js movie-this Rocky

node liri.js movie-this

node liri.js spotify-this-song A Boy Named Sue

node liri.js spotify-this-song Eye of the Tiger

node liri.js spotify-this-song

node liri.js my-tweets

node liri.js do-what-it-says

I thank you for a taking a moment to peruse the repository.
